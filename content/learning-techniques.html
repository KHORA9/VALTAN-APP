        <section id="spaced-repetition">
            <h2>1. Spaced Repetition</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Spaced repetition involves reviewing information at increasing intervals over time, rather than cramming all at once. This technique leverages the psychological spacing effect, where information is better retained when learning sessions are distributed across time.</p>

            <h3>The Science</h3>
            <p>Hermann Ebbinghaus discovered the forgetting curve, showing that we forget information exponentially over time. Spaced repetition combats this by reviewing material just as we're about to forget it, strengthening memory consolidation.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Learn new material</li>
                <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> First review</li>
                <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Second review</li>
                <li><strong>Day 21:</strong> Third review</li>
                <li><strong>Day 60:</strong> Fourth review</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tools and Apps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anki (flashcard software)</li>
                <li>Quizlet</li>
                <li>SuperMemo</li>
                <li>Memrise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with shorter intervals and gradually increase</li>
                <li>Focus on difficult material more frequently</li>
                <li>Use active recall during each review session</li>
                <li>Track your progress and adjust intervals based on performance</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="active-recall">
            <h2>2. Active Recall</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Active recall involves actively stimulating memory during the learning process. Instead of passively re-reading notes, you actively generate answers from memory.</p>

            <h3>The Science</h3>
            <p>The testing effect shows that the act of retrieving information from memory strengthens neural pathways and improves long-term retention more effectively than passive review methods.</p>

            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flashcards:</strong> Write questions on one side, answers on the other</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Testing:</strong> Take practice exams without looking at notes</li>
                <li><strong>Teach Someone Else:</strong> Explain concepts to others</li>
                <li><strong>Write from Memory:</strong> Close your book and write what you remember</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Questioning:</strong> Ask yourself questions about the material</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation Strategy</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Read or study new material</li>
                <li>Close your books/notes</li>
                <li>Try to recall key concepts, facts, or procedures</li>
                <li>Check your accuracy</li>
                <li>Focus extra attention on areas where recall was poor</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="interleaving">
            <h2>3. Interleaving</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Interleaving involves mixing different topics or types of problems within a single study session, rather than focusing on one topic at a time (blocking).</p>

            <h3>The Science</h3>
            <p>While blocking feels more efficient, interleaving forces the brain to actively discriminate between different types of problems and concepts, leading to better understanding and transfer of learning.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Mix algebra, geometry, and calculus problems instead of doing all algebra first</li>
                <li><strong>Language Learning:</strong> Alternate between vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation practice</li>
                <li><strong>History:</strong> Study different time periods or themes in the same session</li>
                <li><strong>Science:</strong> Mix physics, chemistry, and biology concepts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with some blocking to build basic competence</li>
                <li>Gradually introduce more interleaving as you progress</li>
                <li>Focus on related but distinct concepts</li>
                <li>Don't interleave too early—ensure basic understanding first</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="elaborative-interrogation">
            <h2>4. Elaborative Interrogation</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Elaborative interrogation involves generating explanations for why facts or concepts are true, asking "why" and "how" questions about the material.</p>

            <h3>Technique</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When learning a fact, ask "Why is this true?"</li>
                <li>Generate explanations that connect to prior knowledge</li>
                <li>Question the reasoning behind concepts</li>
                <li>Look for cause-and-effect relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fact:</strong> "Plant cells have cell walls"</li>
                <li><strong>Elaboration:</strong> "Why do plant cells have cell walls? Because they need structural support since they don't have skeletons like animals, and the cell wall provides protection and shape."</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="dual-coding">
            <h2>5. Dual Coding</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>Dual coding theory suggests that information is better retained when it's processed through both verbal and visual channels simultaneously.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create visual representations:</strong> Diagrams, mind maps, flowcharts</li>
                <li><strong>Use analogies and metaphors:</strong> Connect abstract concepts to concrete images</li>
                <li><strong>Draw while learning:</strong> Sketch concepts as you study</li>
                <li><strong>Use color coding:</strong> Assign colors to different categories or concepts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mind mapping</li>
                <li>Concept mapping</li>
                <li>Infographics</li>
                <li>Mnemonics with visual imagery</li>
                <li>Storyboarding</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="generation-effect">
            <h2>6. Generation Effect</h2>
            
            <h3>What It Is</h3>
            <p>The generation effect shows that information is better remembered when it's generated by the learner rather than simply read.</p>

            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create your own examples:</strong> Generate examples that illustrate concepts</li>
                <li><strong>Summarize in your own words:</strong> Don't copy—rephrase and restructure</li>
                <li><strong>Create questions:</strong> Generate questions about the material</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Effective learning is not about working harder—it's about working smarter. By implementing evidence-based techniques like spaced repetition, active recall, and interleaving, you can dramatically improve your ability to retain and apply knowledge.</p>

            <p>Remember that these techniques often feel more difficult than passive methods like re-reading, but this "desirable difficulty" is precisely what makes them effective. The effort required to actively recall information and generate connections strengthens learning and memory.</p>

            <p>Start by incorporating one or two techniques into your current study routine, then gradually add others as they become habitual. Consistency and patience are key—the benefits of these techniques compound over time, leading to deeper understanding and better long-term retention.</p>
